This repository will be where I upload my coursework for CSCI 1111- Object Oriented Programming II at Southwest Tech. Btw, they told me to put that really long name there. Nothing I can do.

Also, something pretty neat happened recently. SouthWest Tech revamped their Software Development program, and my work from the previous program,
which you can see in my Object Oriented Programming repository, counted towards completion for part of the new program. So I didn't have to start
over which was quite convinient. Anyways, if you read my last README, you know a few things about me. TBH, not much has changed. Well, actually a
little something has changed. Before, I thought I wanted to do have a career in computer programming. Now I still wouldn't mind doing that, but
I've discovered that my true passion is Astronomy. I've always loved the universe itself, and more than anything I want to be someone who helps
humanity understand it further, or atleast spark curiousity in people about it. However, jops in Astronomy are quite competitive. And Astronomy, as
beautiful and wonderful as it is, isn't all that practical. So, I figured I'd study computer stuff first.
